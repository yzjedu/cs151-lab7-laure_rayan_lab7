#### Objective:
The objective was to create a program that would allow the user to find the cost of flooring five rooms in a house, depending on the dimensions and type of flooring. I practiced using functions and organizing my code.


#### Procedure:
First, we analyzed the problem to decide how it could be divided into functions, and then we wrote out our plan into an algorithm. We started coding, but realized that our initial algorithm did not work the way we expected to at first. After making a new algorithm with new functions, we started coding again, and tested along the way to make sure that our program would work the way that we expected it to. The key concepts we explored were functions and how to divide our code into separate ones.


#### Results:
Our results matched what we expected to get, but only after some trial and error. We tried using various test cases, including our error checking. 


#### Reflection:
The main challenge we encountered was effective ways of dividing our code and ensuring that it would still work altogether. We made sure to think about our program before we started anything, and tested everything multiple times during and after the process. The practice was very helpful, and I think I'm starting to understand functions much more than I had been. Working together with Ray went well, and problem-solving together was fun. We were able to communicate well outside of class, and I had no issues.
